/**
 * TEMPORARY — recording rig. See ./README.md for how to delete it.
 *
 * Puts the real site inside a phone on a desktop screen, at the real device's
 * real CSS size, so it can be screen-recorded without a phone in shot.
 *
 * It is an <iframe>, and that is the entire trick. Scaling a <div> down to
 * 393px would have got the desktop layout drawn small: `@media (max-width:
 * 767px)` resolves against the window, `100vh` resolves against the window,
 * `position: fixed` escapes to the window, and `useMediaFlags` asks the window
 * whether it is a phone. An iframe IS a window — so every one of those answers
 * the way it would on the device, and what gets recorded is the mobile site
 * rather than an impression of it.
 *
 * The outer app is unmounted while the preview is up, not hidden: two copies
 * of a page that runs a WebGL scene is a needless second canvas competing for
 * the GPU with the one being filmed.

/**
 * Takes the desktop scrollbar out of the shot — inside the frame only.
 *
 * The site reserves a 10 px lane for it (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`,
 * src/index.css) and paints the track transparent so it picks up whatever
 * panel it sits on. An iframe composites its transparent pixels over what is
 * BEHIND it, and behind this one is the screen's black — so the lane came out
 * as a black bar with a brown thumb down the right edge of the glass, in every
 * frame of every recording. No phone has that: iOS and Android draw overlay
 * scrollbars that exist only while a finger is moving.
 *
 * Hidden here rather than fixed in index.css because the lane is *right* on a
 * real desktop — it is what stops the whole page sliding sideways when the
 * cart drawer takes the scrollbar away. `scrollbar-width` inherits, so the one
 * declaration also covers the drawers and any inner scroller. Both mechanisms
 * are declared for the reason index.css spells out: Chromium ignores the
 * `::-webkit` rules once `scrollbar-width` is set, and the browsers that do not
 * understand `scrollbar-width` drop it and fall through to them.
 *
 * The lane is handed back to the layout, so the page also lays out at the
 * device's true width instead of 10 px short of it.
